      <p class="1">
        <i>
          Right now I am enjoy some competitive Dragonball FighterZ. Season 3
          just got really interesting with all kinds of changes and development
          in terms of gameplay in the last update (better know as Season 3.5)
          that it is blowing the minds of the whole fighting games community.<br /><br />
          The DBFZ community is huge and really fun and meeting new and all
          kinds of people is what keeps me in this game as well as a huge
          competitive nature. I would recommend this game to anyone wanting to
          get into the fighting game scene.<br />

      <h2>2. What or who got you into video games in the first place?</h2>
      <p class="2">
        <i
          >Well, because I grew up in a tough community, my parents always
          wanted to keep me inside the house. and enter my first ever gaming
          console, the PS2. Since then, I have never looked back, playing the
          ps3 as well as the ps4 and currently working hard to continue my
          tradition by obtaining the ps5 which is another beast on its own.<br />
          <br />
          I am a huge fan of the Playstation for what it has kept me from and I
          would continue supporting the franchise.

      <h2>
        3. What is the longest amount of time you have sat playing games
        non-stop?
      </h2>
      <p class="3">
        <i
          >This is a question lots of gamers recieve on a daily basis.<br />
          <br />
          however the longest I have ever played a game non-stop was a 1 full
          day and the game was, The Last of Us.<br />
          From the moment i picked it up, I was just intreged. Filled with
          suspense and action, the Last of Us alwasy kept me on the edge of my
          seat. I would recommend this to every gamer out there. One of the best
          storyline and intense gameplay of its time.<br

      <h2>4. What is your favorite game from your childhood?</h2>
      <p class="4">
        <i
          >There was so many! Growing up there is no way I can't mention the
          likes of Jack 3 or Ratchet and Clank and Prince of persia which will
          always be one of my all time favourite games.<br />
          <br />
          Before there was any kind of walkthroughs and youtube to make this
          abit easier. My friends and I would sit for hours on trying to
          complete a specific section. We would sit for days on a particular
          part of the and nt make any progress. I still get nightmares of the
          Dahaka chasing me in Prince of Persia 3.<br />

      <h2>5. What's your favorite game of all time?</h2>
      <p class="5">
        <i>
          I personally dont have 1 favorite game, lots of different games gives
          me all kinds of good memories, even the likes of Smackdown vs Raw 2006
          gives me great memories. <br />
          <br />
          At the moment, God of War 4 (AKA God of War) is one of the best games
          I have ever played. As someone that loves action, RPG and a great
          story, God of War ticks all the boxes. Actually I think I will replay
          the GOW. Its that good.
